  <h2>A Little about Me</h2>
  <p class="reddy">
    My name is Catherine Belle Paulk, and I'm a sophomore at UGA. I was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana and attended The Academy of the Sacred Heart, an all-girls Catholic school. Before I moved schoools to Sacred Heart in 4th grade, I went to a co-ed school called St. Catherine's of Sienna. Thoughout middle and high school, I was on the Cross-Country and Track teams. By the time I was in high school, I was one of the oldest on the team -- runners tend to peak in eighth or ninth grade. I was looked up to by my teammates to set a good example and take a loss with dignity and respect. I also participated in the Peer Support program at my school, where select juniors and seniors mentored eighth graders in their year before starting high school.

  <h2 class="reddy">RV adventures</h2>

  From the time I can remember, my family took long roadtrips in our RV. Our travels started out pretty standard, driving to Key West or Tennessee. However, my dad quickly fell in love with the idea of seeing the whole country in the RV, so from about the time I was in fourth grade to the time I was in high school, we travelled the country in the RV every summer, all summer. I've experienced some pretty awesome things now--Oregon's sanddunes the size of the Superdome, halibut and salmon fishing in Anchorage and Homer, Alaska, billygoats on a mountain in Canada, the Redwood Forest in California, and many more things. Each year, he mapped out a different region of the country that we'd see. One summer, we travelled up the East Coast to Maine, the next two summers were spent zigzagging through the middle of the country to Canada, and the following summer we made our way up the West Coast to Alaska. It's an experience not many others can say they've had, and I'm proud to say I've visited 47 of our nation's 50 states.

  <h2>A Little About Work</h2>
  <p class = "reddy">
    Once at UGA, I rushed and pledged Phi Mu Fraternity. In addition, I have a job for Bumble and have worked my way up to become a Regional Manager. I manage the college program at twenty-one schools on the east coast, as well as each team of Campus Directors and Ambassadors. I work alonside three other regional managers, and the experience has been truly amazing. I have had the opportunity to meet the CEO and Founder of Bumble, Whitney Wolfe Herd, who is on the Forbes "30 Under 30" List. I am an intended-finance major and am applying to the Terry College of Business in the Spring of 2018. I have really enjoyed attending UGA thus far, and I can not wait what my future holds for me here at this university.
